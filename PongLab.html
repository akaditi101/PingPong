<UL>
<p>You have just been hired by the Object-Oriented Language Development Company (OLD Co.) They have begun development of what they believe to be a radically new computer game, with the wholly original name of Pong. Figure 1 shows a picture of the OLD Co. Pong game:
<br><br>

<p>Pong is a two player game in which each player attempts to prevent the pong-ball from reaching the wall behind his pong-paddle.  A player deflects the pong-ball before it reaches the wall by placing his pong-paddle into path of the pong-ball. This causes the ball to bounce off of the paddle in the opposite direction. If the ball reaches the wall behind a player's paddle, the opponent scores.  The number of points scored is dependent on the region of the wall contacted by the ball.  The closer to the center of the wall the greater the number of points scored.

<p>The high-paid software engineers at OLD Co. have spent years designing the Pong program.  They have identified the classes that describe the objects the program will use.  They have carefully defined the public interfaces of each of the objects.  The specifications for these classes were handed off to the programmers who completed the majority of the implementation. However, just before the project was completed, all of the programmers were offered huge salaries by start-up dot com companies and simply quit on the spot!  In exchange for a big check I agreed to write these classes for OLD Co.  But being, ever the educator, I decided that writing these classes would be a good experience for you. Of course, I keep the check from OLD Co!

<p>The remainder of this lab describes how to get setup to complete the Pong game and the details of the classes you must write.

<UL>
  <p>Before beginning the lab you will need to do the following things: <br>
    <br>
  <OL>
    <LI>Copy the <strong>Pongtastic Student</strong> folder from Stushare to your 
      network drive.<br>
      <br>
    <LI>This folder contains the following .class files:<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
          <tr> 
            <td> <LI><code><a href="Pong.class">Pong.class</a></code> 
              <LI><code><a href="Pong$1.class">Pong$1.class</a></code>

              <LI><code><a href="PongPaddle.class">PongPaddle.class</a></code> 
              <LI><code><a href="PongScore.class">PongScore.class</a></code> </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </UL>
      <P>These files contain the compiled Java byte-code for OLD Co.'s nearly 
        complete version of the Pong game. <br>
        <br>
    <LI>Mr. Martin has created a java project and a Pongtastic.java file. Pongtastic.java 
      contains a driver class that is used to kick-off the <code>main</code> method 
      of the <code>Pong</code> class. Compile and execute the project. If you 
      have done everything correctly, the Pong game should appear. However, as 
      described above the game is incomplete and therefore it does not work! The 
      paddles and the ball do not move and the score-keeping mechanism does not 
      work.
  </OL>
</UL>

<font size=+1 color='#006400'> <b>Assignment:</b> </font> 
<UL>
  <p>Your assignment is to write and test three classes that are missing from 
    the Pong game. These classes are the <code>PongScore</code>, <code>PongPaddle</code> 
    and <code>PongBall</code> classes. 
  <p><b>The <code>PongBall</code> Class:</b> 
  <UL>
    <p><i>Description:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>The <code>PongBall</code> class describes the object which the Pong application 
        uses to represent the ball that bounces around the screen. The following 
        class diagram illustrates the information and operations that are defined 
        by the <code>PongBall</code> class. 
      <p> 
        <center>
          <img src="PongBallClassDiag.png"> 
        </center>
      <p>When the Pong application is executed it creates a new <code>PongBall</code> 
        object that is positioned at the center of the playing field. Approximately 
        every 10<sup>th</sup> of a second the Pong application calls the <code>move()</code> 
        method on its <code>PongBall</code> object causing the ball to update 
        its position. Following the call to <code>move()</code> the Pong application 
        uses the <code>getX()</code> and <code>getY()</code> methods to find the 
        new location of the ball. If the Pong application determines that the 
        ball would have collided with a wall or a paddle it will invoke the <code>bounceX()</code> 
        or the <code>bounceY()</code> method to change the horizontal or vertical 
        direction of the ball. Finally, the Pong application will draw the ball 
        on the screen at its new location and the process will be repeated again 
        in another 10<sup>th</sup> of a second. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Implementation:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Create and implement the <code>PongBall</code> class in the file <code>PongBall.java</code>.
      <p>To implement the <code>PongBall</code> class you will need to define 
        instance data for the x and y position of the ball as well as the velocity 
        of the ball in the x and y directions. Additional information about the 
        constructors and instance methods of the <code>PongBall</code> class can 
        be found in the <a href="PongBall.html">Java Documentation for the <code>PongBall</code> 
        class</a>. Your implementation of the <code>PongBall</code> class must 
        meet the specifications given in the Java Documentation, so please study 
        it carefully. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Testing:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>One way to test the <code>PongBall</code> class would be to add it to 
        the Pong application and see if the ball begins moving correctly. However, 
        because we do not know precisely how the Pong application uses the <code>PongBall</code> 
        class, it would be very difficult to determine simply by watching the 
        Pong application if the <code>PongBall</code> class behaves correctly 
        in every situation. Thus, we will test its behavior independently. 
      <p>To test the <code>PongBall</code> class you will need to write a class 
        named <code>PongBallTest</code> that contains a <code>main</code> method. 
        The <code>main</code> method in the <code>PongBallTest</code> class should 
        create several <code>PongBall</code> objects and test their instance methods. 
        For example, the following snippet of code will create a <code>PongBall</code> 
        object and test the <code>getX()</code>, <code>getY()</code> and <code>move()</code> 
        methods.  Note: you will execute this class with the <strong>Execute File</strong> button </p>
        <br>
<code>
<blockquote>public class PongBallTest <br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PongBall ball = new PongBall(10, 20, 2, 4); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("x should be 10, x is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getX());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("y should be 20, y is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getY()); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.move();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("x should be 12, x is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getX());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("y should be 24, y is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getY());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.move();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("x should be 14, x is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getX());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("y should be 28, y is: "<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ ball.getY());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}</blockquote></code>    
      <p>Notice that the output of the test program indicates both the correct 
        values and the actual values that are computed. Writing your test programs 
        in this way makes it easy to tell if the class you are testing is working 
        correctly. 
      <p>You will need to add additional code to the <code>PongBallTest</code> 
        class to test the <code>bounceX()</code> and <code>bounceY()</code> methods. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Integration:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Once you have fully tested your <code>PongBall</code> class you can 
	  use the <strong>Execute Project</strong> button.
      <p>Now the Pong application will run using your <code>PongBall</code> class. 
        When the Pong window appears, press the "B" key on the keyboard and the 
        ball should begin bouncing around the playing field. 
    </UL>
  </UL>
  <p><b>The <code>PongScore</code> Class:</b> 
  <UL>
    <p><i>Description:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>The <code>PongScore</code> class describes the object that the Pong application 
        uses to keep track of the score for each player. The following class diagram 
        illustrates the information and operations that are defined by the <code>PongScore</code> 
        class. 
      <p> 
        <center>
          <img src="PongScoreClassDiag.png"> 
        </center>
      <p>When the Pong application is executed it creates two <code>PongScore</code> 
        objects, one for the blue player and one for the green player. Each time 
        the ball contacts the end wall behind the blue paddle, the <code>scorePoints(...)</code> 
        method of the green player's <code>PongScore</code> object is invoked, 
        and vice versa. When invoking the <code>scorePoints(...)</code> method, 
        the Pong application passes it an argument corresponding to the number 
        of points indicated in the region of the wall that was contacted. The 
        Pong application will then invoke the <code>getScore()</code> method to 
        determine the score to be displayed beside the player's name below the 
        playing field. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Implementation:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Create and implement the <code>PongScore</code> class in the file <code>PongScore.java</code> 
        . Your implementation must meet the 
        specifications given in the <a href="PongScore.html">Java Documentation 
        for the <code>PongScore</code> class</a>. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Testing:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>To test the <code>PongScore</code> class write a class named <code>PongScoreTest</code> 
        that contains a <code>main</code> method. Your <code>PongScoreTest</code> 
        program should use a format similar to that used in <code>PongBallTest</code>. 
        Be sure to create several <code>PongScore</code> objects and to call the 
        <code>scorePoints(...)</code> method with several different arguments. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Integration:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Once you have fully tested your <code>PongScore</code> class you can 
        <strong>Execute Project</strong> .
      <p>When you run the Pong application and press the "B" key, the ball will 
        again begin to bounce around the playing field. However, now each time 
        the ball contacts the end wall the opponent's score will be incremented 
        by the appropriate number of points. 
    </UL>
  </UL>
  <p><b>The <code>PongPaddle</code> Class:</b> 
  <UL>
    <p><i>Description:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>The <code>PongPaddle</code> class describes the objects that the Pong 
        application uses to keep track of the size and location of the pong paddles. 
        The following class diagram illustrates the the information and operations 
        that are defined by the <code>PongPaddle</code> class: 
      <p> 
        <center>
          <img src="PongPaddleClassDiag.png"> 
        </center>
      <p>When the Pong application is run it creates two new <code>PongPaddle</code> 
        objects: one for the blue player positioned at the left end of the playing 
        field, the other for the green player positioned at the right end of the 
        playing field. When the blue player presses the "A" key, the Pong application 
        invokes the <code>moveUp(...)</code> method of the blue player's <code>PongPaddle</code> 
        object. Conversely, when the blue player presses the "Z" key the Pong 
        application invokes the <code>moveDown(...)</code> method. Similar actions 
        are taken using the green player's <code>PongPaddle</code> object when 
        the "M" and "K" keys are pressed. The Pong application then uses the <code>getLeftX()</code>, 
        <code>getTopY()</code>, <code>getRightX()</code> and <code>getBottomY()</code> 
        methods to determine where on the screen the blue and green paddles should 
        be drawn. These methods are also used by the Pong application to determine 
        when the ball collides with one of the paddles. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Implementation:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Create and Implement the <code>PongPaddle</code> class in the file <code>PongPaddle.java</code> 
        . Your implementation must meet the 
        specifications given in the <a href="PongPaddle.html">Java Documentation 
        for the <code>PongPaddle</code> class</a>. 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Testing:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>To test the <code>PongPaddle</code> class write a class named <code>PongPaddleTest</code> 
        that contains a <code>main</code> method. Your <code>PongPaddleTest</code> 
        program should use a format similar to that used in <code>PongBallTest</code>. 
        Be sure to create several <code>PongPaddle</code> objects and to call 
        all of the instance methods several several times with several different 
        arguments (when appropriate). 
    </UL>
    <p><i>Integration:</i> 
    <UL>
      <p>Once you have tested your <code>PongPaddle</code> class you can <strong>Execute Project</strong>. 
      <p>When the Pong application is run, pressing the "B" key begins the ball 
        bouncing as before. However, now when the "A" or "Z" keys are pressed 
        the blue paddle will move up or down. Similarly, when the "K" or "M" keys 
        are pressed the green paddle will move up or down. 
      <p>Congratulations! You now have a complete working Pong application!
